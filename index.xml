      <description>I am currently a graduate student at Duke University pursuing a M.S. in Economics and Computation. I intend this blog to be a mix of technical and personal posts. I enjoy climbing, cycling, and running, as well as hacking on interesting problems (usually in R). I have worked previously in various data science roles, and I am currently searching for opportunities (either remote or anywhere in California) following my graduation in May 2020.</description>
