      <description>I am currently a graduate student at Duke University pursuing a M.S. in Economics and Computation. I intend this blog to be a mix of technical and personal posts. I enjoy climbing, cycling, and running, as well as hacking on interesting problems (usually in R). I have worked previously in various data science roles, and I am currently searching for opportunities (either remote or anywhere in California) following my graduation in May 2020.</description>

      <description>These are some things I like:
BlogsGordon Shotwell’s Data Science Blog - I stumbled on Gordon’s blog because of a HackerNews post. I have so far found all of his posts to be very insightful and well thought out.Eric’s Movie Blog - This is a movie blog run by a friend from undergraduate. His movie reviews are extremely well written.Craig Gidney’s Algorithmic Assertions - This is a fantastic math/computer science blog.</description>
